‚õµ Hello everyone, my name is Charunthon Limseelo, and you can call me Boat. Computer Engieering (International Program) Student at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi.

üîä Currently, I am beta-tier Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors and Student Tech Lead in Thailand. Main job for this role would be a technology evangelist with blog contributor and public speaker for engaging people for learning new things from new innovations and new technologies, in the scope of Data + AI and their use cases. Not only on Azure service, but also on-edge devices like small language model.

üï∞Ô∏è Previously, I had worked as Google Developer Student in GDSC KMUTT as event speaker for presenting many cases that based on Google Cloud Platform features, and I left the role in 2022 for continuing in MLSA.

üìù In meantime, I work myself as non-org-related tech blog contributor in many organizations like KBTG, Spark Tech Thailand, Azure Community Thailand, CreatorsGarten, Microsoft, and BornTodev. Yet, I have collaborated the contribution with Public Organization like at The Parliament in the first half of 2024.
