For the session at .NET Conf Thailand 2024, this is likely my final technical session of the year where I’ll dive deep into deploying models for use. In simpler terms, it’s about running an "OfflineGPT" on our own devices without needing the internet, all based on the .NET framework. Additionally, this session will cover foundational topics about AI agents and multi-agents, both for text generation and multimodal applications. We’ll also get to maximize the potential of Thailand’s very first fine-tuned SLM (Small Language Model), which my team and I, along with colleagues from KMUTT and Chulalongkorn University, will be launching for trial during National Coding Day this coming Saturday.

I’d like to express my gratitude to P' Chang Phantip Kokilanon, Jose Barbosa, Giorgio Desideri, the Microsoft MVPs like Teerasej Jiraphatchandej, Wittawat Karpkrikaew, Ajarn Bond Surasuk Oakkharaamonphong, and many other speakers and staff who made this event warm and successful. A huge thanks also to the mentors who guided me before this session, exchanging ideas that shaped the final outcome. I’d also like to thank the team at Seven Peaks Software on their support from the dry run all the way to the event day.
