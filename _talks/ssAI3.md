In this session, we will delve into the cutting-edge world of O1 models and open models, exploring their transformative impact on complex problem-solving and reasoning. Attendees will gain a deep understanding of how these models operate, their real-world applications, and their collaborative nature.

Key topics include:

- An introduction to O1 models and their unique approach to reasoning.
- A comprehensive overview of open models and their role in advancing reasoning capabilities.
- Real-world case studies demonstrating the success of O1 models and open models in various fields.
- Best practices for integrating and implementing these models into existing systems.

The session will feature a live demonstration, where participants can witness the power of O1 models in action and engage in an interactive problem-solving exercise. Join us to explore the future of breakthrough reasoning and discover how these innovative models are solving the unsolvable.
