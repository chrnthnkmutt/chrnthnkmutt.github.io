This session will explore the possibilities of JavaScript beyond web development, showcasing how it can be effectively used in data scienceâ€”whether for building a portfolio, blog, or working with data.

I have introduced key JavaScript libraries and frameworks for statistics, machine learning, and data visualization, such as TensorFlow.js, D3.js, Chart.js, and Sigma.js, along with exciting demos to illustrate their applications.
