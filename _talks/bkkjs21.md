I presented the topic "Developing JavaScript for Open Source Generative AI Developers in Nowadays," introducing the use of JavaScript in open-source AI development. Along with explaining various tools such as GitHub Models, transformers.js, and Ollama.js, along with live demonstrations. I emphasized the potential of using JavaScript for AI development and the benefits of Small Language Models (SLMs) that can run offline on local devices. This video is ideal for developers interested in using JavaScript for AI applications and learning about new tools in the open-source AI ecosystem.

For the repository for testing all use cases of implementing small language model with JavaScript and TypeScript, please visit on my GitHub Link by [clicking here](https://github.com/chrnthnkmutt/slm-js-experiment).
