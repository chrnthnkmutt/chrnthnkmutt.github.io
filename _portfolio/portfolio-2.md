This website is created by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I use the bootstrap framework to help me to design my website. I use the font-awesome to help me to design my website, which I actually use the google font to help me to design my website. Also, there is no need to worry about the responsive of my website because I use the bootstrap framework to help me to design, and no need to install any software to run my website because I use the GitHub page to help me to run my website, also I just install only visual studio code to help me to code my website.
