This repository is being used for visualizing and calculating on Linear Regression with specifically determined on the part of using Eigendecomposition (both Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors) for calculating and visualizing the correlation, variances, covariances, and eigenvectors of correlation-distributed graph. In terms of making this repository, I needed to have some preliminaries or pre-requisited knowledge for contribute on this final project repository for MTH234: Linear Algebra course, which conducted by Assistant Professor Ph.D. Songpon Sriwongsa from Department of Mathematics, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT).
