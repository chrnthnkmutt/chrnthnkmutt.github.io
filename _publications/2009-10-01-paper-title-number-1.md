excerpt: 'Generating humor that aligns with Thai cultural and linguistic nuances is challenging for generative AI. This paper addresses this by fine-tuning small language models (SLMs) on high-quality, non-synthetic Thai humor datasets. The Llama-3.2-3B model and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) were used for efficient parameter tuning. A comprehensive evaluation with Thai participants ensured the generated humor resonated with cultural expectations.'

Despite the impressive capabilities of generative AI across multiple languages, generating humor that aligns with Thai cultural and linguistic nuances remains a significant challenge. Thai humor often relies on context, wordplay, and socio-cultural references, making it difficult for generic models to produce authentic jokes. This paper presents a focused approach to address this limitation by fine-tuning small language models (SLMs) on high-quality, non-synthetic Thai humor datasets. Llama-3.2-3B model was leveraged and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) was employed for efficient parameter tuning, ensuring computational efficiency suitable for low-resource settings. Our work highlights humor as a critical benchmark for evaluating AI’s understanding of language semantics and cultural context. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted with Thai participants to ensure the generated humor resonates with real-world cultural expectations.
